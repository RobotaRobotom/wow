Now that I have read the "docs/intent refined.md" file, I have a good understanding of the WOW (Who Owns What) application requirements. I need to create an implementation plan that includes:

Architecture patterns
Libraries to use
BDD-style tests
Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses these requirements while keeping the implementation simple and focused on current application needs.


WOW (Who Owns What) Application - Implementation Plan
Architecture Overview
JSON Data File

Data Layer

Service Layer

API Layer

FastAPI Endpoints

Validation Layer

Test Layer

I propose a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns while keeping the implementation straightforward:

Data Layer: Responsible for reading and validating the JSON file
Service Layer: Contains business logic for filtering and querying data
API Layer: Handles HTTP requests/responses and parameter validation
Validation Layer: Ensures JSON data conforms to expected schema

Implementation Details
1. Data Layer
The data layer will be responsible for loading and validating the JSON file:

# app/data/json_loader.py
import json
import os
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import ValidationError

from app.models.team import TeamList

class JsonLoader:
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self._data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
        self._last_loaded: Optional[datetime] = None
        
    def load(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load JSON data from file and validate against schema"""
        if not os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"JSON file not found: {self.file_path}")
            
        with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
            raw_data = json.load(f)
            
        # Validate data against Pydantic model
        try:
            TeamList.model_validate(raw_data)
        except ValidationError as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON data: {str(e)}")
            
        self._data = raw_data
        self._last_loaded = datetime.now()
        return raw_data
        
    def get_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get cached data or load if not loaded yet"""
        if self._data is None:
            return self.load()
        return self._data
2. Models Layer
Pydantic models will define the structure of our data and provide validation:

# app/models/team.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from datetime import datetime

from app.models.service import Service
from app.models.value_stream import ValueStream

class TeamAPI(BaseModel):
    team_mission: str
    contact_channels: Dict[str, str]
    team_type: str
    collaboration_preferences: str

class Team(BaseModel):
    team_id: str
    team_name: str
    business_segment: str
    value_streams: List[ValueStream]
    services_applications: List[Service]
    team_api: TeamAPI

class ChangeHistory(BaseModel):
    version: str
    date: datetime
    description: str

class Metadata(BaseModel):
    version: str
    last_updated: datetime
    change_history: List[ChangeHistory]

class TeamList(BaseModel):
    metadata: Metadata
    teams: List[Team]
3. Service Layer
The service layer will contain business logic for querying and filtering data:

# app/services/team_service.py
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from app.data.json_loader import JsonLoader
from app.models.team import Team

class TeamService:
    def __init__(self, json_loader: JsonLoader):
        self.json_loader = json_loader
        
    def get_all_teams(self, 
                     business_segment: Optional[str] = None,
                     value_stream_name: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get all teams, optionally filtered by business segment or value stream"""
        data = self.json_loader.get_data()
        teams = data.get("teams", [])
        
        if business_segment:
            teams = [t for t in teams if t["business_segment"] == business_segment]
            
        if value_stream_name:
            teams = [t for t in teams if any(vs["value_stream_name"] == value_stream_name 
                                           for vs in t["value_streams"])]
                                           
        return teams
        
    def get_team_by_id(self, team_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get a team by its ID"""
        data = self.json_loader.get_data()
        teams = data.get("teams", [])
        
        for team in teams:
            if team["team_id"] == team_id:
                return team
                
        return None
4. API Layer
The API layer will define the FastAPI endpoints:

# app/api/teams.py
from typing import List, Optional
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Depends, Query

from app.services.team_service import TeamService
from app.models.team import Team

router = APIRouter(prefix="/teams", tags=["teams"])

@router.get("/", response_model=List[Team])
async def get_teams(
    business_segment: Optional[str] = Query(None, description="Filter by business segment"),
    value_stream_name: Optional[str] = Query(None, description="Filter by value stream name"),
    team_service: TeamService = Depends()
):
    """
    Get all teams, optionally filtered by business segment or value stream
    """
    return team_service.get_all_teams(business_segment, value_stream_name)

@router.get("/{team_id}", response_model=Team)
async def get_team(team_id: str, team_service: TeamService = Depends()):
    """
    Get a team by its ID
    """
    team = team_service.get_team_by_id(team_id)
    if not team:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Team with ID {team_id} not found")
    return team
5. Main Application
The main application will tie everything together:

# app/main.py
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

from app.data.json_loader import JsonLoader
from app.services.team_service import TeamService
from app.services.service_service import ServiceService
from app.services.runtime_component_service import RuntimeComponentService
from app.services.search_service import SearchService

from app.api import teams, services, runtime_components, search

# Create FastAPI app
app = FastAPI(
    title="WOW - Who Owns What",
    description="API for querying software services ownership by DevOps teams",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Add CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Data file path
DATA_FILE = os.environ.get("WOW_DATA_FILE", "app/data/wow_data.json")

# Dependency injection
def get_json_loader():
    return JsonLoader(DATA_FILE)

def get_team_service(json_loader: JsonLoader = Depends(get_json_loader)):
    return TeamService(json_loader)

def get_service_service(json_loader: JsonLoader = Depends(get_json_loader)):
    return ServiceService(json_loader)

def get_runtime_component_service(json_loader: JsonLoader = Depends(get_json_loader)):
    return RuntimeComponentService(json_loader)

def get_search_service(json_loader: JsonLoader = Depends(get_json_loader)):
    return SearchService(json_loader)

# Register dependencies
app.dependency_overrides[TeamService] = get_team_service
app.dependency_overrides[ServiceService] = get_service_service
app.dependency_overrides[RuntimeComponentService] = get_runtime_component_service
app.dependency_overrides[SearchService] = get_search_service

# Include routers
app.include_router(teams.router)
app.include_router(services.router)
app.include_router(runtime_components.router)
app.include_router(search.router)

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to WOW API - Who Owns What"}
BDD Testing Strategy
